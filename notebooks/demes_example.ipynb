This notebook will  assume you know the basics, so take at least a quick read over there. In short, a demes model includes demes (populations) and the relationships between them, which could be ancestors/descendants, migrations, or instantaneous admixture (pulses). A model is specified as a YAML file, and includes some extra basic information needed to describe the model."
